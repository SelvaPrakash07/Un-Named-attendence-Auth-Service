/**
 * When the end user submits the any request after successful login, the jwt token is required to
 * determine which user currently logged in. This used to capture current user object in all service.
 * {@link TokenValidator}

 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Explanation:</b> Thread Local can be considered as a scope of access, like
 * a request scope or session scope. It’s a thread scope. You can set any object
 * in Thread Local and this object will be global and local to the specific
 * thread which is accessing this object. Global and local at the same time? :
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Values stored in Thread Local are global to the thread, meaning that they
 * can be accessed from anywhere inside that thread. If a thread calls methods
 * from several classes, then all the methods can see the Thread Local variable
 * set by other methods (because they are executing in same thread). The value
 * need not be passed explicitly. It’s like how you use global variables.</li>
 * <li>Values stored in Thread Local are local to the thread, meaning that each
 * thread will have it’s own Thread Local variable. One thread can not
 * access/modify other thread’s Thread Local variables.</li>
 * </ul>
